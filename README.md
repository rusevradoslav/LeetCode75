### 1. Merge Strings Alternately

**Approach:** Use two pointers, one for each string. Alternate appending characters while either pointer is in range.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) — each character visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) — StringBuilder holds the combined result.

**Pattern:** [Two Pointers](#two-pointers-1) — traverse two sequences simultaneously using separate pointers.

**Key Insight:** No length comparison needed — the OR condition and two separate if statements naturally handle strings of any length.

**Code:**
```java
int p1 = 0, p2 = 0;
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

while (p1 < word1.length() || p2 < word2.length()) {
    if (p1 < word1.length()) {
        result.append(word1.charAt(p1++));
    }
    if (p2 < word2.length()) {
        result.append(word2.charAt(p2++));
    }
}

return result.toString();
```

---

### 2. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings

**Approach:** First check if both strings share the same repeating pattern by comparing concatenations. If they do, the GCD of their lengths gives the length of the answer.

**Time Complexity:** O(n + m) — string concatenation and comparison.

**Space Complexity:** O(n + m) — concatenated strings.

**Pattern:** [Math (Euclidean Algorithm)](#math-euclidean-algorithm) — repeatedly divide to find the greatest common divisor.

**Key Insight:** If `str1 + str2` equals `str2 + str1`, they share a common pattern. The GCD of lengths tells us the pattern length.

**Code:**
```java
if (!(str1 + str2).equals(str2 + str1)) {
    return "";
}

int gcdLength = gcd(str1.length(), str2.length());
return str1.substring(0, gcdLength);

// Euclidean algorithm
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

---

### 3. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies

**Approach:** First pass finds the maximum candies. Second pass checks if each kid's candies plus extra meets or exceeds the maximum.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — two passes through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) — result list stores n booleans.

**Pattern:** [Two-Pass Scan](#two-pass-scan) — first pass gathers global info, second pass uses it.

**Key Insight:** You need a global value (max) before you can compare each element against it.

**Code:**
```java
int maxCandies = 0;
for (int candy : candies) {
maxCandies = Math.max(maxCandies, candy);
}

List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
for (int candy : candies) {
        result.add(candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies);
}

        return result;
```

---

### 4. Can Place Flowers

**Approach:** Greedy — plant a flower whenever the current plot and both neighbors are empty. Update the array immediately to prevent adjacent placements.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — modify array in place.

**Pattern:** [Greedy](#greedy) — make the locally optimal choice at each step.

**Key Insight:** Planting at the earliest valid position never blocks a better solution. Skipping a valid spot gains nothing.

**Code:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < flowerbed.length; i++) {
    boolean left = (i == 0) || (flowerbed[i - 1] == 0);
    boolean right = (i == flowerbed.length - 1) || (flowerbed[i + 1] == 0);

    if (left && right && flowerbed[i] == 0) {
        flowerbed[i] = 1;
        n--;
    }
}

return n <= 0;
```

---

### 5. Reverse Vowels of a String

**Approach:** Two pointers from opposite ends. Move inward, swapping only when both pointers point to vowels.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each character visited at most once.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) — char array to allow swapping.

**Pattern:** [Two Pointers](#two-pointers-1) — traverse from opposite ends, swapping when conditions are met.

**Key Insight:** Use else-if to ensure only one action per iteration — either swap, move left, or move right.

**Code:**
```java
char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
    if (isVowel(arr[left]) && isVowel(arr[right])) {
        char temp = arr[left];
        arr[left++] = arr[right];
        arr[right--] = temp;
    } else if (!isVowel(arr[left])) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }
}

return new String(arr);
```

---

### 6. Reverse Words in a String

**Approach:** Trim whitespace, split by one or more spaces using regex, then iterate backwards to build the result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each character processed a constant number of times.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) — words array and StringBuilder.

**Pattern:** [String Manipulation](#string-manipulation) — split, transform, and rebuild the string.

**Key Insight:** The regex `\\s+` handles multiple spaces between words automatically.

**Code:**
```java
String[] words = s.trim().split("\\s+");
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

for (int i = words.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    result.append(words[i]);
    if (i > 0) {
        result.append(" ");
    }
}

return result.toString();
```

---

### 7. Product of Array Except Self

**Approach:** Build prefix products (product of all elements before index i) and suffix products (product of all elements after index i). Multiply them for the final result.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — two or three passes through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(n) standard version, O(1) optimized version (excluding output).

**Pattern:** [Prefix/Suffix](#prefixsuffix) — precompute cumulative values from both directions.

**Key Insight:** Start prefix and suffix with 1 (multiplicative identity) because "nothing to multiply" should not affect the result. Using 0 would break everything.

**Pseudocode (standard):**
```
prefixProducts[0] = 1
for i = 1 to n-1:
    prefixProducts[i] = prefixProducts[i-1] * nums[i-1]

suffixProducts[n-1] = 1
for i = n-2 down to 0:
    suffixProducts[i] = suffixProducts[i+1] * nums[i+1]

for i = 0 to n-1:
    result[i] = prefixProducts[i] * suffixProducts[i]
```

**Pseudocode (space optimized):**
```
result[0] = 1
for i = 1 to n-1:
    result[i] = result[i-1] * nums[i-1]   // prefix in result

suffix = 1
for i = n-1 down to 0:
    result[i] = result[i] * suffix
    suffix = suffix * nums[i]
```

---

### 8. Increasing Triplet Subsequence

**Approach:** Track two candidates — the smallest and second smallest values seen so far. If any value exceeds both, a triplet exists.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only two variables.

**Pattern:** [Greedy](#greedy) — track optimal candidates while scanning.

**Key Insight:** We don't need to track indices — just knowing that smaller values exist before is enough.

**Code:**
```java
int first = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
int second = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

for (int num : nums) {
    if (num <= first) {
        first = num;
    } else if (num <= second) {
        second = num;
    } else {
        return true;
    }
}

return false;
```

---

### 9. String Compression

**Approach:** Use read/write pointers. Read pointer counts consecutive characters, write pointer overwrites the array with the character and its count.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each character read once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — compression happens in place.

**Pattern:** [Read/Write Pointers](#readwrite-pointers) — read ahead while writing in place behind.

**Key Insight:** Compressed output is always ≤ original length, so write pointer never overtakes read pointer.

**Code:**
```java
int write = 0, read = 0;

while (read < chars.length) {
    char currentChar = chars[read];
    int count = 0;

    while (read < chars.length && chars[read] == currentChar) {
        read++;
        count++;
    }

    chars[write++] = currentChar;
    if (count > 1) {
        for (char c : String.valueOf(count).toCharArray()) {
            chars[write++] = c;
        }
    }
}

return write;
```

---

### 10. Reverse Integer Number

**Approach:** Extract digits using modulo, build reversed number by multiplying by 10 and adding each digit.

**Time Complexity:** O(d) — where d is the number of digits (log₁₀n).

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a single variable.

**Pattern:** [Digit Manipulation](#digit-manipulation) — extract and rebuild digits using modulo and division.

**Key Insight:** Check for overflow before multiplying, not after. Java's `%` preserves sign, so negative numbers work automatically.

**Code:**
```java
int reversed = 0;

while (number != 0) {
    if (willOverflow(reversed)) {
        return 0;
    }
    reversed = reversed * 10 + number % 10;
    number /= 10;
}

return reversed;

boolean willOverflow(int num) {
    return num > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 10 || num < Integer.MIN_VALUE / 10;
}
```

---

### 11. Reverse Decimal Number

**Approach:** Split the number into integer and fractional parts. Reverse each part separately, then swap their positions around the decimal point.

**Time Complexity:** O(d) — where d is total number of digits.

**Space Complexity:** O(d) — string operations for splitting.

**Pattern:** [Digit Manipulation](#digit-manipulation) — extract, reverse, and reposition decimal parts.

**Key Insight:** Reversed integer part becomes the new fractional part (scaled by 10^length), reversed fractional part becomes the new integer part.

**Pseudocode:**
```
split number by "." into integerPart and fractionalPart
store the sign, work with absolute value

reversedFractional = reverse(fractionalPart)  // becomes new integer
reversedInteger = reverse(integerPart)        // becomes new fractional

newFractional = reversedInteger / 10^(length of integerPart)
result = (reversedFractional + newFractional) * sign

return result
```

## Two Pointers

### Quick Reference

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Time | Space | Pattern |
|---|---------|------------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [Move Zeroes](#1-move-zeroes) | Easy | O(n) | O(1) | [Slow/Fast Pointers](#slowfast-pointers) |
| 2 | [Is Subsequence](#2-is-subsequence) | Easy | O(n) | O(1) | [Slow/Fast Pointers](#slowfast-pointers) |
| 3 | [Container With Most Water](#3-container-with-most-water) | Medium | O(n) | O(1) | [Two Pointers (Opposite Ends)](#two-pointers-1) |
| 4 | [Max Number of K-Sum Pairs](#4-max-number-of-k-sum-pairs) | Medium | O(n log n) | O(1) | [Two Pointers (Opposite Ends)](#two-pointers-1) |

---

### 1. Move Zeroes

**Approach:** Use slow/fast two-pointer technique. Slow pointer tracks where the next non-zero element should go. Fast pointer scans for non-zero elements to swap.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each element visited exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — in-place swapping.

**Pattern:** [Slow/Fast Pointers](#slowfast-pointers) — slow marks placement position, fast scans ahead.

**Key Insight:** When fast finds a non-zero, swap it with slow's position. This naturally pushes zeros to the end while maintaining order.

**Code:**
```java
int slow = 0, fast = 0;

while (fast < nums.length) {
    if (nums[fast] != 0) {
        int temp = nums[slow];
        nums[slow] = nums[fast];
        nums[fast] = temp;
        slow++;
    }
    fast++;
}
```

---

### 2. Is Subsequence

**Approach:** Use two pointers — one for the subsequence string, one for the source string. When characters match, advance both; otherwise advance only the source pointer.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — where n is the length of the source string t.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only pointer variables.

**Pattern:** [Slow/Fast Pointers](#slowfast-pointers) — subsequence pointer only moves on match, source pointer always moves.

**Key Insight:** We don't need to track matches separately — if the subsequence pointer reaches the end, all characters were found in order.

**Code:**
```java
int sIndex = 0, tIndex = 0;

while (sIndex < s.length() && tIndex < t.length()) {
    if (s.charAt(sIndex) == t.charAt(tIndex)) {
        sIndex++;
    }
    tIndex++;
}

return sIndex == s.length();
```

---

### 3. Container With Most Water

**Approach:** Start with pointers at both ends (maximum width). Calculate area, then move the pointer pointing to the shorter line inward — keeping the shorter line can never increase area.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each element visited at most once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only pointer and max variables.

**Pattern:** [Two Pointers (Opposite Ends)](#two-pointers-1) — start wide, narrow based on which side limits the area.

**Key Insight:** Water is limited by the shorter line. Moving the taller line inward can only decrease width with no chance of increasing height. Moving the shorter line might find a taller one.

**Code:**
```java
int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
int maxArea = 0;

while (left < right) {
    int width = right - left;
    int minHeight = Math.min(height[left], height[right]);
    maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, width * minHeight);

    if (height[left] < height[right]) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }
}

return maxArea;
```

---

### 4. Max Number of K-Sum Pairs

**Approach:** Sort the array first. Use two pointers from opposite ends. If sum equals k, count the pair and move both pointers. If sum is too small, move left pointer right. If sum is too large, move right pointer left.

**Time Complexity:** O(n log n) — dominated by sorting.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — or O(n) depending on sort implementation.

**Pattern:** [Two Pointers (Opposite Ends)](#two-pointers-1) — after sorting, adjust pointers based on sum comparison.

**Key Insight:** Sorting enables the two-pointer approach. Too small? Need bigger numbers (move left). Too big? Need smaller numbers (move right).

**Code:**
```java
Arrays.sort(nums);
int count = 0, left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

while (left < right) {
    int sum = nums[left] + nums[right];
    if (sum == k) {
        count++;
        left++;
        right--;
    } else if (sum < k) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }
}

return count;
```

## Sliding Window

### Quick Reference

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Time | Space | Pattern |
|---|---------|------------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [Maximum Average Subarray I](#1-maximum-average-subarray-i) | Easy | O(n) | O(1) | [Fixed-Size Sliding Window](#fixed-size-sliding-window) |
| 2 | [Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length](#2-maximum-number-of-vowels-in-a-substring-of-given-length) | Medium | O(n) | O(1) | [Fixed-Size Sliding Window](#fixed-size-sliding-window) |
| 3 | [Max Consecutive Ones III](#3-max-consecutive-ones-iii) | Medium | O(n) | O(1) | [Variable-Size Sliding Window](#variable-size-sliding-window) |
| 4 | [Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](#4-longest-subarray-of-1s-after-deleting-one-element) | Medium | O(n) | O(1) | [Variable-Size Sliding Window](#variable-size-sliding-window) |

---

### 1. Maximum Average Subarray I

**Approach:** Calculate the sum of the first k elements. Then slide the window: add the entering element, subtract the leaving element. Track the maximum sum.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each element visited at most twice.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables.

**Pattern:** [Fixed-Size Sliding Window](#fixed-size-sliding-window) — window size stays constant at k.

**Key Insight:** Instead of recalculating sum for each window (O(k) per window), reuse the previous sum: `new_sum = old_sum - leaving + entering`. This reduces each window calculation to O(1).

**Code:**
```java
double windowSum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    windowSum += nums[i];
}

double maxSum = windowSum;
for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
    windowSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, windowSum);
}

return maxSum / k;
```

---

### 2. Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length

**Approach:** Count vowels in the first window. Then slide: increment count if entering char is a vowel, decrement if leaving char is a vowel. Track maximum.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each character visited at most twice.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only counter variables.

**Pattern:** [Fixed-Size Sliding Window](#fixed-size-sliding-window) — window size stays constant at k.

**Key Insight:** Same principle as Maximum Average — maintain a running count instead of recounting vowels for each window.

**Code:**
```java
int vowelCount = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    if (isVowel(s.charAt(i))) vowelCount++;
}

int maxCount = vowelCount;
for (int i = k; i < s.length(); i++) {
    if (isVowel(s.charAt(i))) vowelCount++;
    if (isVowel(s.charAt(i - k))) vowelCount--;
    maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, vowelCount);
}

return maxCount;
```

---

### 3. Max Consecutive Ones III

**Approach:** Reframe as "find the longest subarray with at most k zeros". Expand window with right pointer. When zero count exceeds k, shrink from left until valid.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each element visited at most twice (once by right, once by left).

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables.

**Pattern:** [Variable-Size Sliding Window](#variable-size-sliding-window) — window expands and shrinks based on constraint.

**Key Insight:** We don't actually flip zeros — we just find a window where zero count is ≤ k. The window length is the answer.

**Code:**
```java
int left = 0, maxLength = 0, zeroCount = 0;

for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    if (nums[right] == 0) {
        zeroCount++;
    }

    while (zeroCount > k) {
        if (nums[left] == 0) {
            zeroCount--;
        }
        left++;
    }

    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
}

return maxLength;
```

---

### 4. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element

**Approach:** Reframe as "find the longest subarray with at most 1 zero". Since we must delete one element, the result is window length minus 1 (use `right - left` instead of `right - left + 1`).

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — each element visited at most twice.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) — only a few variables.

**Pattern:** [Variable-Size Sliding Window](#variable-size-sliding-window) — same as Max Consecutive Ones but with k=1 and mandatory deletion.

**Key Insight:** This is Max Consecutive Ones III with k=1, but we must delete exactly one element. Using `right - left` instead of `right - left + 1` accounts for the mandatory deletion.

**Code:**
```java
int left = 0, maxLength = 0, zeroCount = 0;

for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
    if (nums[right] == 0) {
        zeroCount++;
    }

    if (zeroCount <= 1) {
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left);
    } else {
        if (nums[left] == 0) {
            zeroCount--;
        }
        left++;
    }
}

return maxLength;
```

## Prefix Sum

### Quick Reference

| # | Problem | Difficulty | Time | Space | Pattern |
|---|---------|------------|------|-------|---------|
| 1 | [Find the Highest Altitude](#1-find-the-highest-altitude) | Easy | O(n) | O(1) | [Running Prefix Sum](#running-prefix-sum) |
| 2 | [Find Pivot Index](#2-find-pivot-index) | Easy | O(n) | O(1) | [Running Prefix Sum](#running-prefix-sum) |

---

### 1. Find the Highest Altitude

**Approach:** Maintain a running prefix sum representing the current altitude. Track the maximum altitude seen. Compare with starting altitude 0.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — single pass through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) for optimized version, O(n) for explicit array version.

**Pattern:** [Running Prefix Sum](#running-prefix-sum) — accumulate values while tracking a result.

**Key Insight:** We don't need to store all altitudes — just track the running sum and maximum. Don't forget to compare with starting altitude 0.

**Code:**
```java
int maxAltitude = 0;
int currentAltitude = 0;

for (int gain : gains) {
    currentAltitude += gain;
    maxAltitude = Math.max(maxAltitude, currentAltitude);
}

return maxAltitude;
```

---

### 2. Find Pivot Index

**Approach:** Compute total sum first. Then iterate while maintaining left sum. Right sum = totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]. Return index when they're equal.

**Time Complexity:** O(n) — two passes through the array.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) for optimized version, O(n) for dual array version.

**Pattern:** [Running Prefix Sum](#running-prefix-sum) — use total sum to derive right sum from left sum.

**Key Insight:** Instead of building two arrays, use the formula: `rightSum = totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`. Update leftSum *after* the comparison.

**Code:**
```java
int totalSum = 0;
for (int num : nums) {
    totalSum += num;
}

int leftSum = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
    if (leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
        return i;
    }
    leftSum += nums[i];
}

return -1;
```

---

## Key Patterns

### Two Pointers

**When to use:** Problems involving pairs, comparing elements from different positions, or traversing from both ends.

**How it works:** Maintain two pointers that move based on conditions — either toward each other, or in the same direction at different speeds.

**Template:**
```java
int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;
while (left < right) {
    if (condition) {
        // process
        left++;
        right--;
    } else if (leftCondition) {
        left++;
    } else {
        right--;
    }
}
```

---

### Slow/Fast Pointers

**When to use:** In-place array modifications, finding subsequences, or cycle detection.

**How it works:** Slow pointer marks a position (placement or match), fast pointer scans ahead. They move at different rates based on conditions.

**Template:**
```java
int slow = 0, fast = 0;
while (fast < arr.length) {
    if (condition(arr[fast])) {
        // process at slow position
        slow++;
    }
    fast++;
}
```

---

### Fixed-Size Sliding Window

**When to use:** Find maximum/minimum/count in all subarrays of size k.

**How it works:** Initialize window with first k elements. Slide by adding entering element and removing leaving element. Track result across all positions.

**Template:**
```java
// Initialize first window
int windowValue = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
    windowValue += arr[i];
}

int result = windowValue;
for (int i = k; i < arr.length; i++) {
    windowValue += arr[i] - arr[i - k];  // add entering, remove leaving
    result = Math.max(result, windowValue);
}
```

### Variable-Size Sliding Window

**When to use:** Find longest/shortest subarray satisfying a condition.

**How it works:** Expand window with right pointer. When constraint is violated, shrink from left until valid. Track result when window is valid.

**Template:**
```java
int left = 0, result = 0;

for (int right = 0; right < arr.length; right++) {
    // expand: add arr[right] to window state
    
    while (/* window is invalid */) {
        // shrink: remove arr[left] from window state
        left++;
    }
    
    // window is valid, update result
    result = Math.max(result, right - left + 1);
}
```

### Running Prefix Sum

**When to use:** Problems involving cumulative sums, altitude changes, or finding balance points.

**How it works:** Maintain a running total as you iterate. Use it to compute results without storing all intermediate values.

**Template:**
```java
int prefixSum = 0;
int result = 0;

for (int num : nums) {
    prefixSum += num;
    result = Math.max(result, prefixSum);
}
```

---

### Two-Pass Scan

**When to use:** When each element's result depends on some global property of the array (max, min, sum, etc.).

**How it works:** First pass computes the global value. Second pass uses it to calculate results.

**Template:**
```java
// Pass 1: gather global info
int max = 0;
for (int num : nums) {
    max = Math.max(max, num);
}

// Pass 2: use it
for (int num : nums) {
    result.add(num >= max);
}
```

### Greedy

**When to use:** When making the locally optimal choice at each step leads to a globally optimal solution.

**How it works:** At each step, pick the best available option without reconsidering past choices. Works when local decisions don't block better future choices.

**Template:**
```java
for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (isValid(i)) {
        takeAction(i);
    }
}
```

---

### Prefix/Suffix

**When to use:** When each element's answer depends on all other elements — everything to its left and right.

**How it works:** Precompute cumulative values from the start (prefix) and from the end (suffix). Combine them for the final result.

**Why start with 1:** 1 is the multiplicative identity — "nothing to multiply" means multiply by 1.

**Template:**
```java
// Prefix: left to right
prefix[0] = 1;
for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    prefix[i] = prefix[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
}

// Suffix: right to left
suffix[n - 1] = 1;
for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
    suffix[i] = suffix[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
}

// Combine
result[i] = prefix[i] * suffix[i];
```

---

### Read/Write Pointers

**When to use:** In-place array modification where output size ≤ input size.

**How it works:** Read pointer scans ahead, write pointer trails behind overwriting the array. Safe because compressed/filtered output never exceeds original.

**Template:**
```java
int write = 0, read = 0;
while (read < arr.length) {
    // process at read position
    // write result to arr[write++]
    // advance read
}
return write; // new length
```

---

### Digit Manipulation

**When to use:** Problems involving reversing numbers, extracting digits, or building numbers digit by digit.

**How it works:** Use `% 10` to extract last digit, `/ 10` to remove it. Build result with `result * 10 + digit`.

**Template:**
```java
int result = 0;
while (number != 0) {
    int digit = number % 10;
    result = result * 10 + digit;
    number /= 10;
}
```

---

### String Manipulation

**When to use:** Problems requiring splitting, reversing, or transforming strings.

**How it works:** Use built-in methods like `split()`, `trim()`, `StringBuilder` to transform and rebuild.

**Template:**
```java
String[] parts = s.trim().split("\\s+");
StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
for (String part : parts) {
    // transform and append
}
return result.toString();
```

---

### Math (Euclidean Algorithm)

**When to use:** Finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers or lengths.

**How it works:** Repeatedly replace the larger number with the remainder of dividing it by the smaller. Stop when remainder is 0.

**Template:**
```java
int gcd(int a, int b) {
    return b == 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}
```

## Big O Essentials

Big O describes how runtime or space **scales** with input size. We drop constants because we care about growth rate, not exact measurements.

### Common Complexities

| Complexity | Name | Example |
|------------|------|---------|
| O(1) | Constant | Array access, variable swap |
| O(log n) | Logarithmic | Binary search, GCD |
| O(n) | Linear | Single loop, two pointers |
| O(n log n) | Linearithmic | Merge sort, heap sort |
| O(n²) | Quadratic | Nested loops, brute force |

### Why O(2n) = O(n)

If you loop twice, doubling the input still doubles the work. The growth rate is linear either way. Constants don't change the fundamental scaling.

### Quick Rules

| Code Pattern | Complexity |
|--------------|------------|
| Single loop through n elements | O(n) |
| Two separate loops (not nested) | O(n) |
| Nested loops | O(n²) |
| Halving each iteration | O(log n) |
| Loop with halving inside | O(n log n) |
